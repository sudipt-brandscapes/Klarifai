Diwali is India's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (diya or deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects us from spiritual darkness.

Diwali, also called Dipawali or Deepavali, is celebrated every autumn, around the new moon between the Hindu months of Asvina and Kartika. The holiday is celebrated on different days every year, because the Hindu religious calendar is a lunar calendar, while the secular calendar used by most civic and national organizations is a solar calendar. Diwali usually falls in October or November.

Diwali originated as a festival that marked the last harvest before winter. India was an agricultural society where people would seek the divine blessing of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, as they closed their accounting books and prayed for success in the new financial year. Today, this practice extends to businesses all over the Indian subcontinent, which mark the fourth day of Diwali as the first day of the new financial year.

Indians celebrate with family gatherings, glittering clay lamps, festive fireworks, strings of electric lights, bonfires, flowers, sharing of sweets, and worship to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune, and prosperity. Some believe that Lakshmi wanders the Earth looking for homes where she will be welcomed. People open their doors and windows and light lamps to invite Lakshmi in.

Over the centuries, Diwali has become a national festival that is enjoyed by most Indians regardless of faith: Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs.

The Hindu Diwali story has variations across India, all involving deities and demons, kings and karma. In all interpretations, one common thread rings true—the festival marks the victory of good over evil.

- In North India, people celebrate the story of Rama's return to the ancient city of Ayodhya after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps.
- In South India, people celebrate Diwali as the day Krishna defeated Narakasura.
- In western India, the festival marks the day that Vishnu sent Bali to rule the netherworld.

Non-Hindu communities have other reasons for celebrating the holiday:
- In Jainism, it marks the nirvana or spiritual awakening of the spiritual leader Mahavira in 527 BCE.
- In Sikhism it marks the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru, was freed from imprisonment.

## Five Days of Diwali

The first day of Diwali (sometimes called Dhanteras) is celebrated by cleaning and renovating homes and businesses. It's considered good luck to purchase gold or silver items, and at least one or two new kitchen utensils.

On the second day of Diwali (sometimes called Chhoti Diwali), people decorate their homes. The most common decorations are clay lamps (diyas) and designs called rangoli. Rangoli are created on floors and pavements, usually using colored powders, sand, flour, rice, or flower petals.

The third day of Diwali is the main day of the festival. This is when families gather together for Lakshmi puja, a prayer to the goddess. The Lakshmi puja is actually a celebration of three deities: Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth; Ganesh, the elephant-headed god of wisdom; and Kuber, the lord of wealth. The Lakshmi puja is followed by music, mouthwatering feasts, and fireworks festivities.

The fourth day of Diwali (sometimes called Padwa), is the first day of the new year. On this day, friends and relatives visit with gifts and best wishes for the season.

The fifth and last day of Diwali (sometimes called Bahu-dooj) honors siblings. Brothers and sisters celebrate with food, gifts, and parties.

# Questions

- Diwali originated as a festival that marked the last harvest of the year before winter. Why would people celebrate the end of the harvest season, and why would they do so with a "festival of lights"?

People celebrate the end of a harvest for two major reasons, both tied to agriculture.

- In ancient agricultural societies, the end of the season traditionally meant less need for the backbreaking work of harvesting crops. If the harvest was successful, the end of the season also meant the community had abundant food for the winter. Less work, more food—those are both good reasons to celebrate!
- A festival of lights is perfectly timed as autumn turns to winter. Days start getting shorter and nights start getting longer as the winter solstice approaches.

- Can you think of any other autumn harvest festivals?

- Thanksgiving is probably the most familiar.
- Mehregan is a Persian festival associated with the end of the harvest and financial seasons—just like Diwali.
- The Mid-Autumn Festival is considered "intangible cultural heritage" in China, and is also celebrated in Vietnam.
