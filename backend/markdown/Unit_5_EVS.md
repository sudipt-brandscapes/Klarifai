# POLLUTION

## Definition
Pollution is an undesirable change in physical, chemical and biological characteristics of our land, air or water caused by excessive accumulation of pollutants (i.e. Substances which cause pollution).

## KINDS OF POLLUTION
The pollution is of four major types namely air pollution, water pollution, land pollution and noise pollution.

In terms of origin it may be natural or anthropogenic (man-made).

| Black Lung disease |
| It is common among coal miners due to the inhalation of carbon particulates which lead to Lung Cancer. |

The document also includes two images:
1. An image of industrial smokestacks emitting pollution into the air at sunset or sunrise.
2. An image of a polluted beach with a large amount of garbage and debris washed up on the shore.

These images visually represent examples of air pollution and water pollution respectively, reinforcing the textual content of the document.
# AIR POLLUTION

Degradation of air quality and natural atmospheric condition constitute air pollution. The air pollutant may be a gas or particulate matter.

## Air pollutants and their effects

### Particulate matter
- It comprises of small suspended particles such as soot, dust, pesticides, etc., and biological agents such as spores, pollen and dust mites. 
- It causes respiratory ailments such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, etc.,

### Carbon monoxide
- Is a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in automobiles. 
- It is highly poisonous to most animals. 
- When inhaled, carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of blood.

[The image contains three supporting photographs:
1. A power plant with large smokestacks emitting smoke
2. A scene of open burning with thick black smoke
3. Traffic with visible exhaust fumes]
# Air pollutants and their effects

## Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons such as methane, are evolved from soil microbes (methanogens) in flooded rice fields and swamps. They are also generated during the burning of coal and petroleum products.

| Compound | Formula | Structure |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| methane  | CH₄     | H-C-H     |
| ethane   | C₂H₆    | H-C-C-H   |
| propane  | C₃H₈    | H-C-C-C-H |
| butane   | C₄H₁₀   | H-C-C-C-C-H |

## Sulphur dioxide
Sulphur dioxide is released from oil refineries and ore smelters which use the sulphur containing fuels. It causes harmful effects on plants and animals. It causes chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll) and necrosis (localised death of tissues). In human, it causes health problems such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.

## Nitrogen oxides
It causes reddish brown haze (brown air) in traffic congested city air which contributes to heart and lung problems.

| NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) |
|----------------------|
| Nitric Oxide (NO)    |
| Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)|
# Secondary effects of air pollution

## Photochemical smog
Smog is a mixture of smoke and fog. It is formed in the atmosphere under the influence of sunlight by the photochemical reactions of hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and oxygen, resulting in the formation of PAN (Peroxy Acetyl Nitrate).

PAN damages the chlorophyll and thus reduces photosynthesis and growth. It also causes acute irritation of eyes and throat. Visibility of the surrounding is reduced due to smog.

## Acid rain
Gases such as Sulphur di oxide and Nitrogen oxides are oxidized to form sulphuric and nitric acids along with water, and precipitate as acid rain. It damages building materials, plants and animals. It also makes the soil acidic.

| Image Description |
|-------------------|

| Effects of Acid Rain |
|-----------------------|
| ACID RAIN |
| - Soil damage, ecosystems |
| - Corrosion of buildings |
| - Damage human health |
| - Acidification of groundwater, pollute drinking water supply |
| - Aquatic flora and fauna die from high acidity of water |
| - The weakening of trees and insects |
| - Acidification of Rivers & Lakes |
| - Acidification of Soil |
# Control of air pollution

1. The particulates emitted by industries should be controlled by devices such as scrubbers, precipitators and filters.

2. Use of unleaded or low sulphur fuel is to be encouraged.

3. Shifting to non-conventional sources of energy (e.g solar energy, hydel energy, tidal energy, etc.,) in order to reduce the dependance of conventional sources.

4. Smoking in public places should be prohibited, because the cigarette smoke contains carcinogens such as benzopyrene. An average smoker runs the risk of developing heart and lung diseases.

5. Planting of trees along the road sides and around industrial areas.

# WATER POLLUTION

Water pollution is defined as the adding of unwanted substances or the change of physical and chemical characteristics of water in any way which makes it unfit for human consumption.

It is caused by waste products of industries (effluents), domestic sewage, oil spillage, agricultural and industrial run off etc.,

| Urban run off | Oil storage tanks |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Petrol station | Transpiration |
| | Evaporation |
| Ground water flow | Septic tank |
| | Unsaturated zone |
| | Saturated zone |

## MORE TO KNOW

REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO)
- It is the most efficient way of obtaining purified drinking water.
- During this process, pressure is applied on the solution which has more concentration. This reverses the natural direction of water flow and osmosis from high gradient to low gradient.
- This process involves energy expenditure.
- The membranes used for RO process have a dense barrier layer which allow only the water to pass through and prevents the passage of solutes.
- Hence, it is best suited for desalination of sea water (removal of salt).
# Sources and effects of water pollution

Industrial wastes –The industrial effluents containing heavy metals and chemicals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, mercury, zinc, nickel, etc,. are directly released into the water bodies such as lakes, ponds and rivers without proper treatment.

These wastes contaminate the water bodies and make them unsuitable for human consumption.

Hot water is another noted pollutant from industries.

| MORE TO KNOW |
|---------------|
| MINAMATA DISEASE |
| Mercury poisoning due to the consumption of fish captured from mercury contaminated Minamata Bay in Japan was detected in 1952. Mercury compound in waste water are converted by bacterial action into extremely toxic methyl mercury which can cause numbness of limbs, lips and tongue. It can also cause deafness, blurring of vision and mental derangement. |

| MORE TO KNOW |
|---------------|
| Biological magnification of DDT (Dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane) is seen in aquatic food chain. The concentration of DDT gradually increases at each trophic level. DDT inhibits calcium carbonate deposition in the oviducts of certain birds which result in the laying of thin shelled eggs. These eggs can easily break during incubation and the developing embryos are destroyed. |
# Sources and effects of water pollution..

1. Many industries use water as a coolant for the machinery and release of hot waste water into the water bodies causing thermal pollution which affect both the plant and animal life.

   [Image description: A waterfall with brownish-red water cascading down rocks, indicating pollution.]

2. The surface run off - the surface run off from agricultural land is contaminated with pesticides and residues of inorganic fertilizers.

   [Image description: A large pipe discharging polluted water into a body of water, creating turbulence and foam.]

3. The run off from urban and industrial are rich in organic and inorganic compounds. These pollutants contaminate both surface and ground water resources.

   [Image description: A heavily polluted water surface with various types of garbage and debris floating, including plastic bottles and other waste materials.]
# Sources and effects of water pollution...

4. **Oil spills** – An oil spill is an accidental discharge of petroleum products in oceans and estuaries from capsized oil tankers, offshore drilling and exploration operations. It can cause drastic damage to the marine and coastal bio diversity.

5. **Domestic Sewage** – It is rich in organic matter and detergents. Decomposition of organic matter increases the nutrient content of the water bodies.

6. Availability of excess nutrients results in algal bloom on the surface of water resulting in the deficiency of oxygen content (BOD – Biological Oxygen Demand). This in turn leads to the death of aquatic organisms. This process is known as Eutrophication.

The image contains three photographs illustrating the points:

1. An aerial view of an oil spill in the ocean, showing a large red slick spreading from a small vessel.
2. A polluted beach with debris in the foreground and murky waves.
3. A scene of a polluted waterway with debris floating on the surface and individuals sitting on what appears to be a piece of debris in the water.

These images visually represent the pollution sources and effects described in the text, highlighting the environmental impact of water pollution from various sources.
# Control of water pollution

1. Sewage treatment plants should be installed to treat sewage before releasing into water bodies.

2. Excessive use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers should be avoided.

3. Biological control of insect pests and organic farming is to be followed in order to reduce the dependence on pesticides and inorganic fertilizers.

4. By legislation and strict enforcement.

5. By creating social awareness among people about the water pollution and the need for pure water.

| Pipes take water to treatment center | Screening stage | Primary treatment stage | Secondary treatment stage | Final treatment stage | Filtered into river |

# SOIL POLLUTION

Soil pollution is the unfavorable alteration of soil by the addition or removal of substances which decrease soil productivity and ground water quality.

It usually results from different human activities like dumping of waste, use of agro chemicals, mining operations and urbanization.

[The image contains two photographs illustrating soil pollution:

1. A large area covered with various types of garbage and waste materials, spread across the ground as far as the eye can see.

2. A scene showing a large pile of garbage and waste in an urban or semi-urban setting, with buildings visible in the background. The waste appears to be overflowing from a large container or dump site.]
# SOIL POLLUTION : Causes and effects

- The industrial solid waste and sludge contain toxic organic and inorganic compounds as well as heavy metals.

- The radio active waste from nuclear power plants and nuclear explosions also contaminate the soil.

- Fly ash contains fine particulates which are released from thermal power plants. It settle on the ground and cause pollution.

- The domestic waste is rich in organic matter and undergo decomposition.

- The hospital waste contains a variety of pathogens that can seriously affect human health.

The image also contains three photographs illustrating different aspects of soil pollution:

1. A large pile of industrial and electronic waste, showing various discarded materials and debris.

- Landfills
- Incineration
- Source reduction
- Composting
- Recycling

The image contains three photographs illustrating different waste disposal methods:

1. A large yellow garbage truck dumping waste at a landfill site. The truck is tilted, with various types of trash spilling out onto a large pile of mixed waste.

2. A modern incineration facility with a distinctive curved roof structure. The building is white and has a sleek, industrial design against a blue sky with some clouds.

3. A person using recycling bins. The image shows several large blue recycling containers, and an individual is seen placing items into one of the bins.

These images visually represent some of the waste disposal methods listed in the bullet points, specifically landfills, incineration, and recycling.
# Land filling

- Most municipal solid waste in India is deposited in landfills
- It is the most traditional method of waste disposal
- Source of groundwater pollution
- Waste is directly dumped into disused quarries, mining voids or borrow pits.
- It is generally used for domestic waste

The content is accompanied by four images illustrating different aspects of landfilling:

1. A large yellow dump truck unloading waste at a landfill site.
2. A blue garbage truck tipping its contents onto a large pile of mixed waste.
3. A close-up view of a mound of mixed garbage including plastics and other discarded materials.
4. A wide view of an expansive landfill site with scattered debris and some buildings visible in the background.

These images visually reinforce the text by showing the practical aspects of waste disposal in landfills, including the equipment used and the environmental impact of large-scale waste accumulation.
# Incineration

- Prior to 1940, incineration was common in North America and western Europe.

- Many incinerators were eliminated because of foul odors and gritty smoke

- Currently, about 15% of municipal solid waste is incinerated.

| A modern incineration facility with a curved, wave-like roof structure. The building is predominantly white with a tall smokestack. | An incineration plant with a tall red and white striped chimney. The facility has yellow and green buildings, and a red truck is visible in the foreground. |
# Incineration

| Pros: | Cons: |
|-------|-------|
| - Reduce volume 90%, weight 75% | • Create air pollution |
| - Heat from burning converted to electricity | • Concentrates toxins in ash |
| | • More costly than landfills, as long as space available |

The image contains two additional visual elements:

1. A Monopoly-style game board section with the following text:
   - "CHANCE"
   - "INCINERATORS"
   - "POLLUTANTS ARE PRODUCED IN THE PROCESS"
   - "COST: A LOT!"

2. A photograph showing an open-air waste incineration scene. The image depicts a person standing near a burning metal container in what appears to be a landfill or dump site. Dense black smoke is rising from the fire, illustrating the air pollution aspect mentioned in the cons list.
# Composting

- Harnessing natural decomposition to transform organic material into compost

- Materials such as plants, food scraps, and paper products can be decomposed into the organic matter.

- The organic matter that is produced from recycling can be agricultural uses.

- Usually this method of recycling is done by putting the materials in a container and let to stay there until it decomposes.

The image contains two photographs:

1. A person tending to plants near a black compost bin in a garden setting.
2. A large pile of dark, rich-looking compost or soil in an outdoor area.

These images illustrate the composting process and its end result, supporting the textual information provided about composting methods and uses.
# OCEAN DUMPING

- Ocean dumping is the dumping or placing of materials in the ocean, often on the continental shelf.

- A wide range of materials is involved, including garbage construction and demolition debris, sewage sludge, dredge material, waste chemicals, and nuclear waste.

- Sometime hazardous and nuclear waste are also disposed but these are highly dangerous for aquatic life and human life also.

The document includes three images illustrating the effects of ocean dumping:

1. A coastline littered with debris and waste materials.
2. A polluted beach with waste scattered across the sand and in the water.
3. An illustration showing various types of waste floating in ocean water.

These images visually reinforce the text's message about the harmful impacts of ocean dumping on marine environments and potentially human health.
| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
|------------|-----------------|
| • Convenient | • There are three main direct public health risks from ocean dumping: |
| • Inexpensive | • Occupational accidents, injuries and exposures |
| • Source of nutrients for fishes and marine mammals. | • exposure of the public to hazardous or toxic materials washed up on beach sand. |
| • Vast amount of space is available. | • human consumption of marine organisms that have been contaminated by ocean disposal. |
| • All type of wastes are disposed. | • Highly dangerous for aquatic life. |
# Recycling

- It is basically processing or conversion of a waste item into usable forms

- Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics.

- But recycling is not a solution to managing every kind of waste material.

- For many items like plastic bags, plastic wrap, yogurt cups, margarine container etc. recycling technologies are unavailable or unsafe.

The image also includes a photograph showing recycling bins and a person walking past them. The bins appear to be large, cylindrical metal containers with dome-shaped lids, likely for collecting recyclable materials. The scene is outdoors, with trees and other vegetation visible in the background.
# Recycling

## Benefits

- Saves money, raw materials, and land.
- Encourages individual responsibility.
- Reduces pressure on disposal systems.
- Japan recycles about half of all household and commercial wastes.
- Lowers demand for raw resources.

The image shows a detailed illustration of various phytoremediation techniques using different plants to address different types of environmental contamination. The landscape is divided into sections representing different contamination scenarios and remediation methods:

1. **Rhizofiltration**
   - Plant: Sunflower
   - Contaminant: Radioactive
   - Process: Roots of plants such as sunflowers with dangling roots on ponds or in greenhouses can absorb pollutants such as radioactive strontium-90 and cesium-137 and various organic chemicals.

2. **Phytostabilization**
   - Plants: Willow trees and poplars
   - Contaminant: Organic
   - Process: Plants such as willow trees and poplars can absorb chemicals and keep them from reaching groundwater or nearby surface water.

3. **Phytodegradation**
   - Plant: Poplar tree
   - Contaminant: Organic
   - Process: Plants such as poplars can absorb toxic organic chemicals and break them down into less harmful compounds which they store or release slowly into the air.

4. **Phytoextraction**
   - Plants: Indian mustard and brake ferns
   - Contaminant: Inorganic metal
   - Process: Roots of plants such as Indian mustard and brake ferns can absorb toxic metals such as lead, arsenic, and others and store them in their leaves. Plants can then be recycled or harvested and incinerated.

The illustration depicts:
- A landfill area
- Polluted groundwater entering the system
- Decontaminated water exiting
- An oil spill area
- Polluted leachate
- Soil and groundwater layers

The image provides a comprehensive overview of how different plants can be used to remediate various types of environmental contamination, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of phytoremediation techniques in addressing soil and water pollution.
