Vihang Karnik Roquette India Private

M: Hi Vihang. Good afternoon. I am Alifya here from Brandscapes. How are you?

R: Well, I am feeling hectic. We had a very grand event yesterday which I was leading, and it finally concluded yesterday.

M: Nice. What kind of event?

R: Family Day for the India employees. So, this is an event every year where we invite employees' families to our office and then we take them to a venue for an evening kind of gathering plus So, my cultural activities, So, my fun activities and then followed by cocktails and dinner.

M: Alright, So, I hope you enjoyed it.

R: Well, I could not enjoy the function, but of course, I enjoyed organizing it because I was the one coordinating and leading the team who was coordinating for it.

M: So, thank you for taking out time for us even though you're exhausted. I also, have my colleague Prithvi with us today.

M: OK. So, where are we?

M: So, Vihang as you know today we want to speak to you about executive coaching programs that you've attended, especially as part of Roquette. But before we get into that conversation give us a small introduction of yourself, a little bit about your professional journey, and your role in Roquette. What do you do in the market?

R: Sure. So, I'll start from the start. I am a commerce graduate from Pune and I alSo got my post-graduation from Pune in human resources. I started working in 2007 with a company called Global Innov India Private Limited which is into temp staffing. Moving from there I've worked in companies such as M Modal, which was into medical transcription an American company moving to Sandoz, and Novartis, which were all this while part of 1 entity I joined Sandoz but later moved to Novartis as the legal entity. So, five years there before joining Roquette, and it's been about five and a half years now with Roquette. So, predominantly my role has been around compensation and benefits, Except for the first 2-3 years where I was doing more client servicing in HR as I was part of the staffing team, but after that, I think it's more or less been compensation and benefits and a little bit of HR business partnering for last few years.

R: In Roquette, I head India compensation and benefits which includes 5 factory establishments and one head office, plus a few sales representatives in single areas. So, all put together in India, we have approximately 1100 plus headcount, which includes white collars plus unionized blue collars. Apart from this 1100 we also, have a contractual headcount of about 900. That contractual headcount is more or less managed locally, by the country management.

M: What do you mean by contractual headcount? What are the differences?

R: Since we are a manufacturing setup, we are very labor intensive, and we have many physical jobs. Shop floor kind of job. So, we are into starch manufacturing dominantly. But we also, manufacture many other food and pharma ingredients. So, the lowest level Jobs are very labor intensive. we need people who can lift, the gunny bags and put them on the manufacturing conveyor belt. So, that's those are the contractors. So, that's that's their primary not just the lifting one, but the basic ground level jobs are being managed by our contract staff. Of course, contract staff would also, include So, someone like drivers for the company vehicles and cleaners and gardeners, et cetera. So, all in all, the work in a

1
plant that could be outsourced is outsourced through contract staff, but that itself is around 900 for us.

M: Oh, OK, OK. So, on payroll, it is approx 1100.

M: Are you all based in Mumbai or are you spread across different cities?

R: No, in fact, Mumbai is just our headquarters for India. in Mumbai, we have about 115 people But our major spread is across India. we have a presence in the north which is Uttarakhand, Rudrapur. The industrial area of Rudrapur city is called Pantnagar. That's where we have our biggest plant. And then we have a presence in Gujarat where we have two factories, one which is closer to Ahmedabad in an industrial area called Odhov and the other one which is a little far from Ahmedabad, around 60 kilometers in a town called Viramgam. And then we have presents in north North Karnataka which is Gokak and in Andhra Pradesh in a town called Nellore.

M: And these are mainly factory setups for the sales office?

R: No. These are all factory setups.

M: So, what I heard is the head office is only in Mumbai everything else is in the sales office or factory outlets.

R: There's no sales office.

M: OK.

R: The Mumbai office happens to be the center point for sales teams, but it's only the factories predominantly and then there are a few sales representatives across India in pockets. We have a few in Delhi, a few in Bangalore, a few in Hyderabad, and one or two in Chennai that's all.

M: if I have to ask you, going forward about maybe 2-3, five years into the future, what is so what do you aspire for yourself professionally?

R: So, as I was telling majority of my experience is in compensation and benefits. So, given that as a fact I look at 2 streams that I can get into as my future aspiration. One would be a larger compensation and benefits role probably at a regional level or a global level. For us, the global headquarters happens to be in France. So, the central roles for the organization are all placed in France And then there are regional roles for respective regions and then the country roles.

R: now, because I've been handling the country role in Roquette for some time now about 5-6 years. So, in Bangi and Novartis, I was handling country-level roles. So, I think my future target would be to get into a larger CNB role or just move around within HR and try my hands on business partnering and in addition to my compensation I'm already doing that. I'm already an HR business partner now in Roquette for one of our factory establishments in Ahmedabad.

M: And what does the business partnering role encompass like? I don't understand that very clearly as a business partner, what do you do?

R: So, it's supporting business to run smoothly As far as the human resource angle is concerned. So, whatever needs to be done to ensure that human resource stability is being maintained is what comes under the purview of a business partner for human resources. Now when it comes to factory establishment, primarily you have to look at things such as if there are unions you have to be on the union issues, you have to understand the industry relations of a factory establishment. You have to take care of all the labor compliances for the factory. Ensure that there is adequate manpower
available at any given point of time in the factory, in a given shift for running the shift manufacturing activities smoothly.

R: these are some of the basics and then it goes more qualitative as you go up on broad-level activities which are like managing your talent, knowing what you have in terms of human resources in your organization, and how you can grow them. What would you need additionally as a skill dynamics from the outside market? What are the organizational changes expected in connection with the market changes? Like if there is any restructuring being done or required to be done and with those restructures, does it attract any skill development? Is talent shuffling to be done? Budgeting... how much of the manpower would you need for upcoming years to come and how do you want to use it?

R: So, these are very broad level things that I've told you, but there are many ground level activities that a business partner and his team have to do in the factory.

M: I can imagine that. So, to be able to achieve your aspirational level of business. Things that you're looking at least for the 2-3 years from now. What are some of those skill sets do you think are important, or maybe behavior, attitude, or mindset? What more do you need to help you achieve the goal or anything you feel you need to develop more to be able to reach that goal?

R: Yeah, you are always developing. You are never there. Even today I still feel that there are things that I need to improve in my existing role in terms of role capacities as well as performance capacities. So, it's a journey and what you're asking for me to reach where I want to reach in say 5-7 years, of course, there'll need to be a lot of skill upliftment And I think the key elements as you grow up the ladder are basically how good are you in terms of timing and allocating your resource is very, very critical.

R: You have 10 10-member teams from whom you get support. But if you don't know, or if you don't handle them well, if you don't. Assign a good combination of roles to your teams. I think the success is quite far. So, as you grow up, I think the most essential task is to manage your stakeholders within your team as well as the outside of your team, your regular customers, or touch points within an organization or outside of the organization. So, that's the main skill I would say you have to manage as a leader.

M: And what do your managing stakeholders include? What kind of attitude you still would need to develop to be able to do this well or as the job demands?

R: So, for a human resource manager to be in any, any, any sub stream of human resource like I take care of compensation and benefits. There is a team that takes care of talent acquisition. There is a team for talent development and then for compliance, whichever stream within HR you manage. As a human resource partner, you have to manage more of your internal stakeholders than outside. So, outside you will have a few consultants to work with or a few agencies that you take support from but the majority it's your internal stakeholders. We as HR hardly connect with our business customers. We don't, we don't get an opportunity to meet Nestle, or Britannia in Mondelez, where we sell our products, but we get in touch with the people who front end to the Nestle and the Mondelez to sell our product. So, they become indirect or direct. They become our customers in House customers, So, understanding their needs in terms of business as well as in terms of their personal aspirations career growth and opportunities available within the organizations become supercritical.

R: So, managing stakeholders for HR is predominantly managing the needs of your business and business drivers, which is your human resources. So, for that, I think that I think what you need to repeatedly and ongoingly do is to be with them and get connected with them as frequently as you can.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

I think half of your people's problems are Solved when you talk to them. So, being there, talking to people, and getting them the Solutions is the key.

M: Like it's a relationship business at the end of the day.

R: It is a relationship business. We are not manufacturing anything within HR. What best people do you have to manufacture here? I think you have to manage them better.

M: I know. Now when I say executive coaching programs, what is your perception of them? What comes to your mind when will work?

R: So, I've been through two to three different types of uh leadership development programs.

M: OK.

R: And fortunately or unfortunately, I don't know, probably. Fortunately, all of them have been different.

R: I have been part of a hardcore classroom training leadership development program.

M: OK.

R: I have been part of a leadership development program which was more of an experiential program but for a shorter duration and now in Roquette currently I am undergoing a leadership development program which is a very good blend of theory and on-the-ground experience mentoring coaching and future development assessments career assessments, etcetera, etcetera and that too on a longer term.

M: OK.

R: So, this program is going to go on for at least 2 and a half years. I have already finished and this is a global program.

R: So, what I'm saying is there are various types of leadership development programs but the key is to understand your organization's needs when you design a program. If you implement a ready-made So, solution that is available in the market it may or may not help, and that too may or may not help all of your resources. It might help a few resources in your team who need the basics of it, and then they use that as a stepping stone to grow ahead that learning program, but for resources who are at least half cooked and need support to get further grilled or going further I think readymade programs don't work as effective as otherwise. So, it is important to understand your business requirements and business dynamics. What does your business expect from you? And then accordingly design a training program a learning program or a development program that supports your business needs.

R: So, the current program that I'm undergoing I feel is the best one that I've been part of so far. In despite being under the leadership development program in Novartis, which itself was a very, very good exhaustive program. But as I said, it was a program that was shorter in duration. However, a good blend of theory in practical experiences, but a very short one, not even 2-3 months. So, I feel is a very short time.

R: The leadership development programs have to be a little lengthy where you give people time to learn, understand, and implement. Simultaneously work on their routine and again come back, learn, understand, and implement. So, repetitive learning and implementing help. So, that's why I feel this. This one is going well.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

M: So, yes, the interesting point you mean and I don't want to especially get into more detail about the program you undergoing now. But before we do that, one very interesting thing you said was it's important to design the program for the specific needs of the organization and those goals.

M: So, who designed these programs? Do all do it in-house. Is there a coaching partner that comes on board or how are these programs designed? If you can shed So, me light on that.

R: although I have not been part of the teams who design such leadership development programs, unfortunately, I've been quite confined to compensation and benefits portfolios for quite sometime now.

R: I was just thinking my work life that way is boring with numbers.

M: Everyone feels that way.

M: So, I was asking you about who designs these programs. Is there a coaching partner or is there an internal team that does it? If there is a coaching partner, then you can share the name of this partner and how you also, select it, or if it's done internally, then a little bit about who is the team that does it.

R: Yes. It depends. It is completely organized based on how you want to design your learning development programs. So, in Novartis because of the size of the organization we had an in-house university. In a sense we had our in-house trainers, we had our in-house content developers and more often than not, it was 100% in-house, developed and run and implemented learning program that Novartis had. I think they used to take support from So, my consultant, but I don't recollect who. I think it was Hewitt or Someone else. I don't recollect because I was not part of the course development or the course designing program team. I didn't give that much attention to it, but I think it was Hewitt.

R: In Roquette, although we have an in-house development talent development team in the global France office. They take help from Mercer for their leadership development program designs. So, the core structure I is from Mercer and then we are building on that structure to customize it to our needs.

M: So, the program that is run; are there coaches from Mercer who come and help you with conducting and facilitating the program, or is your in-house department that does that?

R: Yeah, the coaches are mostly in-house.

R: So, in this program, we had about 8:10 classroom learning sessions out of which only 2 were external. So, we had one professor from, a very renowned French university. A Paris University came in to take us through business finances and we had one external consultant who was there to coach us on effective people, communication, and presentation skills. So, apart from these two, all other sessions were in-house.

M: OK, that is very helpful. Now let's get to the heart of the matter. you've already told me a little bit about this program that you're doing, but can you tell me a little more? You mentioned that the program is for 1-2 years, but then how is this placed? Is there an e-learning module followed by classrooms? One-on-one component. how many of the features offline online you can do?

R: most of the learning programs start virtually and never see daylight into a physical meeting or a classroom or industrial tool type of learning but thankfully this one started with a physical meeting which was organized by our group in Spain. So, we have a factory in Spain. So, worldwide this is a group of 20-21 people who were nominated and selected from different countries out of a total population

5
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

of about 10-12,000 employees that we have. So, these 20-22 people get selected every year and then they are put through this program of 1-2 years every time.

R: So, fortunately, I've been part of this year's session. This year's program started with classroom training and visits to various factories of our own in Spain. Classroom training was typically around subjects that are more of a necessity for you to sustain and reach a leadership level.

R: first of all when you are at any leadership level have a good business understanding. So, there were sessions on knowing what Roquette does worldwide, how we manufacture, how we reach our markets, what our markets are what could be our future potential markets and how are we working towards it. So, these were So, me of the sessions and I'm telling this to you as a combination of business acumen sessions. But these were all individual sessions in themselves, So, quite exhaustive content, but very internal, with little focus on external at the external future potential for Roquette business, but otherwise focused more internally.

R: So, these were the starting sessions for us to understand Roquette better. Apart from that, we had sessions on understanding the financial side of a business. So, how do you read a balance sheet? How is it made? What all contributes to a balance sheet is what was covered and then what contributes to a good profit, what contributes to a loss, how you report a few things in your balance sheet from your business etcetera. So, it was quite a granular level of business finance training, but quite interesting. So, being a commerce student, it's it's easier for me to understand

M: From what I understand you start with a few classroom sessions with this entire batch of 20 to 25 people and then going forward, how did it proceed? Did you guys separate into smaller batches? Is there So, me kind of middle assessment that happens?

R: So, all of these sessions had both a joint classroom session and then breakouts into smaller groups. So, after every session, we had multiple such breakouts. For example, in a session on business finances, we learned a couple of topics then we broke out into smaller groups. We were given a few tasks or a few things probably a balance sheet to be tallied with the entries corrected we passed or So, something of that So, rt then in the business acumen session we were told about or taught about what roquette does then we were asked to break out and brainstorm on a business problem in roquette and how we could have handled it in a better way So, there were sessions designed like this that it was not 100% a classroom session. Within classroom sessions, there were breakout sessions for us to basically think and come back.

M: Did it happen online?

R: No, it was physical. we were all there in Spain.

M: OK, So, how long were you in Spain for the?

R: 15 Days.

M: So, after the initial 15 days of these offline programs what happened next? Because you mentioned you've been doing this program for about a year.

R: So, within those 15 days, we had factory visits. after understanding what we do and how we do it on paper, it was also, time for us to see how it is done on the ground. So, we had a very, very detailed experience. Every department of that factory was involved in inducting us or taking us through the detailed process of manufacturing.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

R: I mean receiving raw material putting it on a conveyor belt, going it through the cycles of production, and then there are multiple cycles of multiple things being produced because what we take is corn But what goes out out are 10 things out of a corn.

R: So, how those 10 things are manufactured? And then finally how each of it is packed, labeled, and priced? Where does it go? Which warehouse? What has to go in? What warehouse? How far is the travel time? how far can we have a travel time for a product and how far we cannot? So, it was that granular because the expectation was that we understand what we do to the core of it. So, the industrial visit was very exhaustive because when you travel in a plant, I don't know if you've visited a plant, but if you visit a plant...

M: I have actually, but that was for the automobile, not for food.

R: So, automobiles are very modern and state-of-the-art plants, but if you visit a food or oil or a starch it is completely different.

M: Does a Tata tea plantation tourist count as a food plant?

R: It may but again, it's a flat unit if I'm not wrong. So, typically manufacturing units are quite vertical. You have to climb every building, you have to climb about 8-10 floors to see the entire cyclic process of a thing that you manufacture. So, it's quite exhausting and tolling on your body. The plant that we were in was one of the biggest plants worldwide that we have in Roquette. It was exhaustive, but it was equally exciting to see how Roquette takes care of the environment, the surrounding people the plants. Roquette in general is very mindful of all these things being a family organization, family family-based company.

R: So, after these 15 days, we went back to our den, and then there were few sessions of online learnings or you can say a few modules for us to read through that continue even today. So, we get a monthly newsletter through Oxford, which we have tied up with. That comes to us every month and then there are online follow-up sessions arranged by the global learning team, there are counseling sessions arranged through the people...

R: I spoke to you about that session on people connect and presentation skills. So, the coach of that session had a one-on-one session with each of us after our physical training was done.

R: The second phase of this development program is the project phase. All of us are currently in the project phase and at the very fag end of the project phase. So, we all are divided into batches. We all are given one global subject to work on it could be anything. So, anything that is on priority for the group worldwide in Roquette. So, for example, what is on priority for the next 5-6 years in Roquette is things such as sustainable development. We are very, very focused on sustainable growth and sustainable way of doing business. So, that is a topic that one of the sub teams is working on. The focus is on reducing manufacturing overheads and wastage.

M: OK.

R: And that project is separate in itself, but some of our 23-20 team members, I mean a group of these 20-23 is parked for that project. I'm involved in a project called Compliance Influencers Project. Commonly, compliances of any So, rt are looked at very negatively in the sense that it's a tick the box activity you do it because you have to do it and not because you look at it as a business driver.

R: So, I am part of the project which is focusing on project compliance as a business driver. similarly, there are many other subjects around 11-12 subjects which are given to us as projects and at a global level project.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

M: So, these projects that you're working on are working as a group, right?

R: But the groups are very small. So, for example, my project it's a group of two. It was supposed to be three though, but the third member had maternity plans and she had to take leave during this period. She dropped out of the program eventually, but then we would.

M: So, where is your partner base?

R: The existing partner now is based in India, thankfully, so we have no time gap.

M: So, you said the lady that dropped out was based where?

R: She is in France. So, if she was part of our project we would have had to do a lot of time management as well but there are groups where there are team members one sitting in Singapore and the other sitting in the US, and I don't know how they're managing it. So, that's another challenge. This is again a very, very practical challenge in nature that when you work in a global setup, you have to do these time adjustments to work with your cross-border colleagues.

M: I feel that pain very occlusionally.

R: So, these are the types of projects and they are very large scale in themselves and it's a global scale project. Even though two of us are sitting in India, we have to coordinate with all the countries, and all the continents and get inputs and data, facts, and numbers from all of them. The outcome of this project will be presented to our Executive Office, which is the top management and bosses in our global office including our global CEO. That's the audience to which we are presenting and hence the outcome has to be very meticulous.

M: OK, OK. And what's the next step? So, you mentioned right now you're in the project planning stage and there are still about six months in the program left. So, after this presentation, what happened? If you have an idea of that?

R: Yes, of course. So, we have been briefed about the entire 1 ½-2 years. I'm saying 1 1/2 to two years because it has a lot of dependency on the global leaders, especially in the third phase, So, it's divided into three phases. the first phase, as I said, was more of a classroom and experiential learning. The second phase was implementing those learnings in your project and after the project, there are two major tasks one if your project is successful and is accepted by the group you're findings and your outcomes it start being implemented across the globe.

R: So, if for example my project is well accepted by the group, the recommendations and the output outcomes of my project are accepted by the group, we will have to start implementing the compliance influencing programs across the globe across the organization. And that is where I and my partner will play a major role in implementing those programs, along with the help of our global compliance team, global legal, and compliance team. So, that is one.

M: OK.

R: But the more important part of this development program is the third phase, where we will now undergo a mentorship program and the mentors for all of us will be Global Executive Office members.

M: OK.

R: So, the people that will now present to the 10-eleven of them will be our mentors for the third phase. Their availability is a little weird and that's why the schedule of 1 ½ years may get extended to two years. Depending on their availability.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

M: OK.

R: So, as part of mentorship program, they will work with us on a very individual level to understand our journey. Our personalities, our expertise on our jobs, what skills do we possess, what skills do we need to improve on. depending on what our future aspirations are. Work on our future aspirations as well in a way because there might be people like if you ask me also, apart from the two things that I've told you, I don't know what else I can get into.

M: Right.

R: So, one of the questions that were asked to me by the head of Region, Americas who was also, there in Spain. So, we had a one-on-one meeting. I'll tell you about that later, but we had one-on-one meetings with various global leaders there in Spain and one of them was with the head of Americas, the North, as well as So, uth Americas. And he asked me a question as to why do you want to grow only within HR. why would you not want to explore originates in a manufacturing setup or say a commercial setup where you work on sales and marketing kind of roles?

R: And that struck me. I said, why not to myself? And you know it's a taboo only in India. I feel otherwise outside of India, especially Europe and the Americas moving your career stream is not a big thing. People move from being medical practitioners to a lecturer to trekking experts and do anything that's not ideal for either them or society.

M: Yeah, you need a break from the industry you are very comfortable with. Just do So, something new.

R: Yes.

R: I think he was coming from that culture and that's why he was proposing it to me. So, I don't know, I mean, I might start getting interested in other fields of my work, So, that is exactly what these mentors will explore in this third phase with all of us. They will assess us on what kind of role probably would suit us better than what we are currently doing, or if what we are doing is what we are born for. Then I think they'll help us in growing laterally, vertically in that role itself. So, that's the role of mentors that they will play in our life for 4-5 months.

R: The outcome of that would be a chalked career path and an agreed career path for all of us, which will be designed, discussed, and agreed upon between the US and the global leaders. So, that's the outcome that helps in a way for us to know where we will grow in the next 5-6 ten years within the organization.

M: That's a moving program. What I am a little curious about is how this group, this group of 20-25 people chosen to begin with.

R: So, of course, there are many criteria to it. I have not selected any of my team members on this program yet my boss has selected me or my super bosses have selected me.

M: OK.

R: But what I've given to understand is there are criteria such as one is of course the number of years that you have spent within the organizations it could not be below 2 - three years is, I think what the criteria is. then your performance your. we are very much a traditional organization that still follows a long scale of rating performance ratings. We have a seven-scale performance rating.

M: Wow, OK.
Pj Excel-Transcript_Vihang Karnik_ROQUETTE India Private

R: Yeah, I know it So, unds quite weird, but traditionally we have been using it and we still trust in it.

R: So, the performance rating has to be a level above average at least. So, our average is on target, and a level above on target is about a target which is 2 levels below the top rating. So, we have an average average is not bad, but he's good. I mean, it's not a bad rating, but it's on target.

M: It's as expected, but nothing impressive.

R: So, you've been given tasks and you have done your task on target but as you, as you are I expected nothing special.

M: Yeah.

R: But as you contribute more and more, you do things that are not expected out of you. You contribute to your things in a better way to improve what is there. As of today, you grow you. You're, the likelihood of getting a higher rating is higher. So, the minimum criteria are about the target for consecutive 2 years, uh. these are the technical grounds. But then there are a lot of feedback sessions that happen in talent discussion.

R: So, we have So, something called talent discussions. these discussions happen at at leadership level only. when I say leadership level, it's the leadership of every country who jointly comes on board and discusses the available talents within the country on a common platter. So, just to give you a test of it India's country head and India's HR head would be on a joint call with the rest of the countries' HR heads and business heads and they all will be monitored or the session will be conducted by the Global HR head and the global Learning Head or Talent Development Head who will ask nominations from each country, with their detailed contributions for last couple of years, and these contributions will get across the board discussed. So, if for example, my name is being discussed and my reporting manager says that Vihang was involved in So, and So, activities and he has done above excellence in this task, this task, etc. He got connected with the group's regional teams to deliver the best output. He got connected with the global teams to deliver this output. So, when these projects are being discussed, the regional and global teams that I've worked with will be asked to validate and give their feedback on the board. All this feedback is conSo, validated, and studied to arrive at a final nomination of UH for this learning program, what we call uh. I didn't tell you what we call it, So, we call it a Roquette forward program.

M: That's a nice name move.

R: Yeah, So, I think it's quite an exhaustive although Little Micro managed quite an exhaustive but if you work with the European company you are bound to have micro managements So, that's part of our life now.

M: And is this available or open to from a certain level above, or does it apply to?

R: Yes, it's mid-level management and above uh from the fact that you cannot practically promote a person from an entry level directly to a management level.

M: So, this is like this from what you've explained to me, Sounds like it was a senior in your level program.

M: What do you think At maybe one or two levels below there is a need for Something like this?

R: We have it. it, So, we call it ODC programs. Although I have not been part of it I don't. I don't have details of it,

R: But when you talk to Prasad you can ask him about ODC. He's the one who's driving ODC levels in India, and ODC is a global program again which is run at various levels. So, we have So, something called ODC1, ODC2, and ODC3.

M: I should fresh batch and then a graduate batch at that time.

R: Not the fresh batch but those who are, say, a couple of years into the experience and have potential to grow are the ones who would make part of ODC 1, then ODC 2 would be typically people who have I'm not sure of the exact service service years criteria, but about 5 to 7 years into experience and again performance and potential is a given. So, that is what qualifies for ODC2 probably and then Mid and senior level is what qualifies for a DC3 but ODC three is quite niche. ODC3 will only have country-level leaders participating in it. even in India, I will not be eligible for ODC 3. I will probably be eligible for ODC 2 because ODC3 the country heads of all my functions would be qualified for ODC 3.

M: Can you give me a very brief comparison between the program that you've done before with Novartis, the smaller program that you mentioned, and this one?

R: So, Novartis as I told you at the beginning, the main difference was the time frame and secondly the blend of the program. So, the first program I attended there was an M1. like ODC1, ODC,2, and ODC 3. The M1 was for people who are becoming people managers for the first time. Employees who were becoming or going to become people managers for the first time So, that was the phase when I had for the first time a couple of people reporting to me and that is why I was part of that program. that was more of a classroom program of one week where I was put under various skills which helped me understand my team better.

M: So, that was a little more focused from what I understand, this is So, comprehensive.

R: Focused and it covered things such as assessment through which you understand what the Reds and the Greens are.

M: SWOT analysis.

R: what type of personality you are and what type of personalities are there around you? It's on the tip of my tongue, but I am not recollecting it now. So, there was such analysis done and I've been part of that analysis several times after that, even as part of this Roquette's program, we were put under a little exhaustive or little in-depth analysis of the same thing again, I'm not recollecting the name. I'll text you So, on.

R: In Sandoz or Novartis, we covered that part where we could understand that when you're working with people you may have different personalities sitting around you working with you. So, handling treating, and interacting with different types of people may have to be different.

R: You cannot talk to Alifya the way you talk to Raj. Raj may \ understand and be motivated by the language that I use with little stress on words. we have to do this. this is what you will be able to do, and that's probably a way Raj gets motivated but Alifya would say, no, no, no, no. you're being very rude. You're being very harsh. Talk to me in a little polite way and only then I'll understand what you're saying. So, there are different ways. you have different types of personalities that you have to understand and then handling them in that way is what mainly was the learning out of that training program of one week.

R: And that's primarily because we were handling people for the first time and then there was also, a focus on how you can delegate things because when you become a people manager for the first time, it's difficult for Someone to trust the other person and get your work done through that person. I hope

you understand what I'm trying to say because you have been doing 10 things on your own for the last 10 years, and you are best at it, but you don't know how you can get it done through Someone else you don't know if the other person will do it to the same level of proficiency.

M: And then you start micromanaging, even though you don't intend to.

R: Absolutely. So, there's a complete trust issue at the beginning if you're not used to managing work through your team. So, there's a trust issue that you have to deal with, which you have to get rid of. how you should put trust in your team and how you should not put trust in your team is what alSo, was taught to us. when you're when you're giving any task to your team what is it that you should say and what is it that it you should not say? how should you monitor? monitoring is very, very important when it comes to delegating because you cannot work with the mindset all the time that the person that you've delegated to is aware equally of the situation and importance of that task as you are, and that's why downloading work is not just downloading or delegating work along with the work you also, have to download the relevance around that work why is it important to you? Why is it important to the person, that we are supposed to deliver? Why that person is following up with you for this thing is alSo, very critical for that person to understand, at times you feel irritated with the back-to-back follow-ups that you get, but you have to look at the other side of the coin knowing that the very fact that the other perSo, n is following means that you and your deliveries are important for him And that's exactly why he's he's looking up to you to deliver it in time. And in the in the quality that he needs. These things may not be understood by your junior every time, by your subordinate, So, you have to ensure that you're not just delegating a task but also, making him or her understand the importance of it. Then follow up. Keep a tab on frequent checks and balances in between, but just the adequate checks and not too much. So, all these things were, were part of that first session, quite interesting as I talk about it, I'm recollecting the days. So, it's quite a deja vu for me.

M: And this would have been how long? A couple of weeks, a couple of days.

R: one week, one week, and that too, it wasn't a full day one-week session. I think it was a one 1/2 of the day. say 3 to 4 hours a day for a week.

M: And in comparison to this program that you're going through now how often do you have to take, I know the 15 days were dedicated in Spain, but once you were back in the country how was it? How do you balance it with your work, or how is it scheduled around?

R: It's quite a task I can tell you because connecting with the global team is not that frequent. It's once a month, but for the project as So, as we get into the project phase it's me and my team members who are working on it. Two project managers are assigned to us who are the functional experts because we we are working on compliance as the top topic, our project managers are one is the head of the global compliance team, and the other is his deputy. these are these are our project managers and then there is one executive office member who is our mentor. So, you understand there's this sponsor, or a mentor on the top. Then there are two project managers and there are two of us who are the project team members who were executing the project on the ground. So, we have to have very frequent connections with our project managers at least once a week or once in two weeks, and then once a month connect with the sponsor, r or the mentor of the project.

R: And in between these connections is what we do on the ground between me and my team member and project work was a hell of hectic because of the time gap that the geographical distances and everything and the mindset difference Because when we reach out to a sales head in Americas, he doesn't know who Vihang is or who Javed. Javed is my project partner. he doesn't know who Vihang is and who Javed is. So, we have to start from scratch and they don't understand why Vihang is reaching

out to me for information that is very confidential for my function. why do I have to tell him; How did I approach my customer? How my customer focuses on compliances that we do at Roquette.

R: So, we have to start from scratch. So, it is quite exhausting. It is quite tooling. first of all, getting their time slots is itself difficult because we are mostly connecting with respective functional leaders for information and discussions and then getting information from them via emails and the data front is even more difficult because first of all they hesitate, and then they cross check that we have been approached by Vihang for XYZ things. Are we supposed to share and only they have a go ahead they start sharing it in bits and pieces? So, right from the connections to the collation of information to representing that information in the way that the project needs it was hectic. So, along with my regular work, it was difficult. we have managed it. Thankfully, the timelines got a little extended this time because of leadership's availability and non-availability.

R: we were supposed to present our projects in France, in perSo, n in November, which got extended later to December, and now it has been postponed to January and to not be in physical presence it will be virtual. So, finally, we are presenting in January.

M: OK, good luck with that.

R: Thank you.

M: That was it. Those were the questions I had and thank you for such a detailed and elaborate explanation of this program.

M: It is extremely helpful.

R: No problem.
