# QUESTION

1. You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains
   distilled water and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic
   solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will
   you identify the contents of each test tube?

## 2.1 UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ACIDS AND BASES

### 2.1.1 Acids and Bases in the Laboratory

#### Activity 2.1

- Collect the following solutions from the science laboratory–
  hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄), nitric acid (HNO₃),
  acetic acid (CH₃COOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium
  hydroxide [Ca(OH)₂], potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium
  hydroxide [Mg(OH)₂], and ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH).
- Put a drop of each of the above solutions on a watch-glass one by
  one and test with a drop of the indicators shown in Table 2.1.
- What change in colour did you observe with red litmus, blue litmus,
  phenolphthalein and methyl orange solutions for each of the
  solutions taken?
- Tabulate your observations in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1

| Sample solution | Red litmus solution | Blue litmus solution | Phenolph-thalein solution | Methyl orange solution |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
|                 |                      |                      |                           |                        |

These indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by
change in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in
acidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try
out some of these indicators.

#### Activity 2.2

- Take some finely chopped onions in a plastic bag along with some
  strips of clean cloth. Tie up the bag tightly and leave overnight in
  the fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and
  bases.
- Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour.
- Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl
  solution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on
  the other.
